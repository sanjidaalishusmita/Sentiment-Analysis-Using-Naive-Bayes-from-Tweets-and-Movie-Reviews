# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Naive-Bayes-from-Tweets-and-Movie-Reviews
Sentiment Analysis or Opinion mining on movie
reviews. Sentiment is a thought, view, or attitude, especially
one based mainly on emotion instead of reason For this we need
to classify each and every review, this can be done through
classifiers such as NAÏVE BAYES, SVM, K-NN, we preferred
NAÏVE BAYES classifier, since it is a probabilistic approach we
depend upon each word’s probability to be positive and negative,
through this we will classify the review to be one of those. After
classifying each review the sentiment is drawn based on the count
of the classes. Consider 50000 reviews, in those reviews there will be
positive as well as negative reviews of that particular movie, the
review is purely based on the public opinions being expressed in
the portal. After classifying the reviews we go for the max count
method to predict the outcome.
This algorithm is proposed in order to avoid the fake reviewing
system followed now a days to promote the movie by the
producers and crew of the movie. This gives the straight opinion
of the public.
